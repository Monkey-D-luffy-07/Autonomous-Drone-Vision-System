## Conclusion: ðŸ“’

In conclusion, this approach illustrates an efficient method for detecting, matching, and visualizing features across consecutive video frames utilizing **OpenCV** and **Tkinter.** By employing the **FAST** and **ORB** algorithms for feature detection and descriptor matching, the program facilitates real-time analysis of motion and changes within the video. The computed metrics, such as match count and average distance, offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of the feature matching process. This method can be applied across a range of computer vision applications, including object tracking, motion analysis, and scene reconstruction, making it a versatile tool for visual analysis.
